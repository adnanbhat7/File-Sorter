# File Sorter by File Type

This project is a Simple Python-based file sorter that organizes files in a given directory based on their file types (extensions). It helps declutter directories by sorting files into relevant folders automatically.

## Features
- Sorts files into folders based on common file types:
  - Image files (`.jpg`)
  - Video files (`.mp4`)
  - Excel files (`.xlsx`)
  - PDF files (`.pdf`)
- Creates new folders for each file type if they donâ€™t exist.
- Handles duplicate files by removing them if they already exist in the target folder.

## Files in the Repository
- **Automatic file Sorter.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the file sorter logic and explanations.
- **FileSorter_pyton.py**: The Python script version of the file sorter for easy execution.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.
